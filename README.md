# Automation--Assessment
This is an example that tests a new user performing an assessment. The main test class (SubmitAssessment.java) instantiates the DB_Reset.java class to create a new account, the Login.java class to log into the site, the Assessment.java class to complete the sites assessment and then the DB_Assessment.java class to validate the results.
